# Octopus Minmax Bot 🐙🤖

## Description
This bot will use your electricity usage and compare your current Smart tariff costs for the day with another smart tariff and initiate a switch if it's cheaper. See below for supported tariffs.

Due to how Octopus Energy's Smart tariffs work, switching manually makes the *new* tariff take effect from the start of the day. For example, if you switch at 11 PM, the whole day's costs will be recalculated based on your new tariff, allowing you to potentially save money by tariff-hopping.

I created this because I've been a long-time Agile customer who got tired of the price spikes. I now use this to enjoy the benefits of Agile (cheap days) without the risks (expensive days).

I personally have this running automatically every day at 11 PM inside a Raspberry Pi Docker container, but you can run it wherever you want.  It sends notifications and updates to a variety of services via [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise), but that's not required for it to work.

## Web Dashboard

After starting the bot you can access the web dashboard on `localhost:5050`

- Make changes to your config through the dashboard without needing to restart
- Access and read logs
- See graph of savings (coming soon)

### HomeAssistant Addon

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Feelmafia%2Foctopus-minmax)

OR

To install this third-party add-on:

1. Open Home Assistant > Settings > Add-ons > Add-on Store.
2. Click the menu (three dots in the top-right corner) and select Repositories.
3. Paste the GitHub repository link into the field at the bottom:
https://github.com/eelmafia/octopus-minmax
4. Refresh the page if needed. The add-on will appear under **Octopus MinMax Bot**.


### Running Manually
1. Install the Python requirements.
2. Configure the environment variables.
3. Run `main.py`. I recommend scheduling it to run it at 11 PM in order to leave yourself an hour as a safety margin in case Octopus takes a while to generate your new agreement.

### Running using Docker
Docker run command:
```
docker run -d \
  --name MinMaxOctopusBot \
  -p 5050:5050 \
  -v ./logs:/app/logs \
  -e ACC_NUMBER="<your_account_number>" \
  -e API_KEY="<your_api_key>" \
  -e EXECUTION_TIME="23:00" \
  -e SWITCH_THRESHOLD=2 \
  -e NOTIFICATION_URLS="<apprise_notification_urls>" \
  -e ONE_OFF=false \
  -e DRY_RUN=false \
  -e TARIFFS=go,agile,flexible \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -e BATCH_NOTIFICATIONS=false \
  -e WEB_USERNAME="<whatever_you_want>" \
  -e WEB_PASSWORD="<whatever_you_want>" \
  eelmafia/octopus-minmax-bot
```
or use the docker-compose.yaml **Don't forget to add your environment variables**

Note : Remove the --restart unless line if you set the ONE_OFF variable or it will continuously run.

#### Supported Tariffs

Below is a list of supported tariffs, their IDs (to use in environment variables), and whether they are switchable.

**None switchable tariffs are use for PRICE COMPARISON ONLY**

| Tariff Name      | Tariff ID | Switchable |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Flexible Octopus | flexible  | ❌          |
| Agile Octopus    | agile     | ✅          |

#### Setting up Apprise Notifications

The `NOTIFICATION_URLS` environment variable allows you to configure notifications using the powerful [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) library.  Apprise supports a wide variety of notification services, including Discord, Telegram, Slack, email, and many more.

To configure notifications:

1.  **Determine your desired notification services:**  Decide which services you want to receive notifications on (e.g., Discord, Telegram).

2.  **Find the Apprise URL format for each service:**  Consult the [Apprise documentation](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki) to find the correct URL format for each service you've chosen.  For example:

    *   **Discord:** `discord://webhook_id/webhook_token`
    *   **Telegram:** `tgram://bottoken/ChatID`

3.  **Set the `NOTIFICATION_URLS` environment variable:** Create a comma-separated string containing the Apprise URLs for all your desired services.  For example:

    ```bash
    NOTIFICATION_URLS="discord://webhook_id/webhook_token,tgram://bottoken/ChatID,mailto://user:pass@example.com?to=recipient@example.com"
    ```

    Make sure to replace the example values with your actual credentials.

4.  **Restart the container (if using Docker) or run the script:**  The bot will now send notifications to all the configured services.
